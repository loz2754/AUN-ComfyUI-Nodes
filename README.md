## Node categories:

#### Node Control - Command the Flow

_AUN Node state controllers orchestrate bypass, mute, and collapse states so you can keep complex setups lean and responsive:_

- AUN Node Controller (`AUNMultiUniversal`) is a universal bypass/mute/collapse controller (1–20 slots). Nodes are chosen by ID or titles. It can take on the role of any of the more specific Node Control nodes.
- AUN Group Controller (`AUNMultiGroupUniversal`) targets ComfyUI Groups (by group name) rather than individual nodes, with various filtering options.
- Bypass By Title (`AUNSetBypassByTitle`) sets bypass state for nodes whose titles match any of the provided titles (one per line)
- Mute By Title (`AUNSetMuteByTitle`) same as Bypass By Title but mute instead of bypass.
- Group Bypasser (Multi) (`AUNSetBypassStateGroup`) set the bypass state of all nodes in groups selected from the graph.
- Group Muter (Multi) (`AUNSetMuteStateGroup`) same as Group Bypasser but mute instead of bypass.
- Multi Bypass Index (`AUNMultiBypassIndex`) control bypass state of multiple nodes by IDs using an index. Select an index to activate one set of nodes while bypassing others.
- Multi Mute Index (`AUNMultiMuteIndex`) same Multi Bypass Index but mute instead of bypass.
- Node Collapser & Bypasser Advanced (`AUNSetCollapseAndBypassStateAdvanced`) set collapse and bypass or mute state for multiple nodes. Has a combined override or separate toggles.
- Node State Controller (`AUNNodeStateController`) control collapse + bypass or mute for nodes by ID, group, or title.

#### 🔁 Toggle & Emoji Conventions

To provide a fast, visually consistent understanding of node states, AUN nodes use standardized text+emoji labels for BOOLEAN inputs:

| Context                                   | label_on      | label_off                     | Meaning                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bypass switches (per group / per title)   | `Active 🟢`   | `Bypass 🔴`                   | Active = node(s) participate; Bypass = skipped/disabled path              |
| Mute switches (per group / per title)     | `Active 🟢`   | `Mute 🔇`                     | Active = node(s) process; Mute = silenced (no processing / effect)        |
| Global (AllSwitch) for Bypass/Mute groups | `All 🟢`      | `Individual`                  | ON forces every listed group active; OFF defers to each individual switch |
| Model / generic on/off (where applicable) | `Active 🟢`   | `Off 🔴` (or domain specific) | Pattern reused when no special semantics                                  |
| Collapse / Expand (per node or group)     | `Collapsed ▶` | `Expanded ▼`                  | Collapsed hides node body (compact); Expanded shows full contents         |

#### File Management

- Main Folder Manual Name (`MainFolderManualName`) switch between a manual name and an automatic filename for the output path. Also returns the MainFolder, useful if you want to use the MainFolder in another node, and a boolean which can be used to switch other nodes.

- Path Filename (`AUNPathFilename`) generates a file path and filename from various components and placeholders. Ideal for creating dynamic and organized output structures for saved images. Mainly for use with AUN Save Image.

- Path Filename Video (`AUNPathFilenameVideo`) build a folder path and a tokenized filename for AUN Save Video.

---

#### Image

- Empty Latent (`AUNEmptyLatent`) generates an empty latent image with specified dimensions. It offers options for predefined aspect ratios, random dimension swapping, and batching, making it a flexible starting point for your image generation workflows.
- Image Loader (`AUNImgLoader`) loads an image and returns the image data, a mask, the original filename, and a cleaned filename. The cleaned filename is useful for prompts or file outputs in other nodes.
- Image Preview With Title (`AUNTitleImagePreview`) optional text input is mirrored to the node's title.
- Img2Img (`AUNImg2Img`) provides a comprehensive Img2Img node, allowing you to switch between txt2img and img2img modes. It handles image loading, resizing, and encoding into the latent space, providing essential outputs for further processing.
- Load & Resize Image (`AUNImageLoadResize`) load images with optional automatic resizing. Supports FramePack nearest-bucket sizing, maintains aspect ratio, and provides filename information for workflow organization.
- Load Image Single/Batch 3 (`AUNImageSingleBatch3`) load a single uploaded image or cycle through a batch of images from a folder with multiple selection modes, including increment, random, range and search filtering by filename patterns.
- Resize Image (`AUNImageResize`) resize an input image using the same strategies as AUN Load & Resize Image, including FramePack buckets and fill/crop anchoring.
- Save Image (`AUNSaveImage`) is a versatile image saver with advanced filename customization and metadata embedding.

---

#### Video

- Save Video (`AUNSaveVideo`)

---

#### KSampler

- KSampler Inputs (`KSamplerInputs`) provides a convenient way to set the KSampler inputs (sampler, scheduler, CFG, and steps) in one place. This is useful for organizing your workflow and making it easier to manage these common parameters.
- KSampler Plus (`AUNKSamplerPlusv3`) a progressive two-pass sampler with latent-upscale, pixel-space upscale and optional final refinement. Also outputs a string of the selected upscale methods for use in filenames.

---

#### Loaders

- Ckpt Load With Clip Skip (`AUNCheckpointLoaderWithClipSkip`) speaks for itself.

---

#### Loaders+Inputs

- Inputs (`AUNInputs`) a comprehensive 'all-in-one' node for setting up a generation pipeline. It loads a checkpoint, creates a latent image, and prepares various parameters for sampling and saving, all in one place.
- Inputs Hybrid (`AUNInputsHybrid`) loads a standard checkpoint (UNet+CLIP+VAE), or a diffusion UNet model with separate CLIP and VAE files, but essentially the same as AUN Inputs.

---

#### Logic

- Boolean (`AUNBoolean`) a Boolean switch with a third option: True, False, or Randomize. Outputs the resolved boolean and an optional label "True/False".

---

#### Text

- Add-To-Prompt (`AUNAddToPrompt`) add text to either before or after a prompt, with a choice of always, never or 50/50 random.
- Name Crop (`AUNNameCrop`) crops a string to a specified number of words.
- Negative Prompt Selector (`AUNMultiNegPrompt`) selects one of the 10 preset negative prompts to use.
- Show Text With Title (`AUNShowTextWithTitle`) a show text node with a difference - shows text from an input, and dynamically sets the node's title from a text input upon execution. Useful when selecting from a list of text input nodes to see which one was selected.
- Single Label Switch (`AUNSingleLabelSwitch`) a simple boolean toggle with text label. Useful for adding the same text to more than one node.
- Strip (`AUNStrip`) trim digits and whitespace from the start and end of a string. Simple cleaner for building filenames or labels.
- Text Index Switch (`AUNTextIndexSwitch`) switch between up to 20 text inputs based on index number. Useful for dynamic prompt selection with control over how many sockets are visible on the node. Inputs take the title of the connected node, which is also used as the label.
- Text Index Switch 3 (`AUNTextIndexSwitch3`) select one of ten text inputs based on an index. Also outputs the label of the selected input.
- Text Switch 2 Input With Text Output (`TextSwitch2InputWithTextOutput`) allows you to choose between 2 text inputs, or none, with text output. Labels can be customized.
  TIP: Double-click the node or right-click and select 'Compact mode' to hide configuration widgets.

- Get Connected Node Titles (`AUNGetConnectedNodeTitles`) gets the titles of up to 10 connected nodes.
- Model Name Pass (`AUNModelNamePass`) a pass-through node for a MODEL that also extracts its name (full and shortened). Traces back to find the loader node.
- Model Name Shorten (`AUNModelShorten`) takes a full model name string and outputs a shortened version suitable for filenames.
- Random Any Switch (`AUNRandomAnySwitch`) randomly selects one of several connected inputs of any type and outputs it, along with the index of the selected input.
- Random Number (`AUNRandomNumber`) generates random integers within specified range. Useful for seed variation and randomization in workflows.
- Random Text Index Switch (`AUNRandomTextIndexSwitch`) generates an index based on the selected mode (Select: fixed value, Increment: cycling through range, Random: random within range) and uses it to select from up to 20 text inputs.
- Random/Select INT (`AUNRandomIndexSwitch`) outputs an integer based on mode: Select for fixed value, Increment for cycling through range, Random for random value within range.

- `git clone https://github.com/loz2754/AUN-ComfyUI-Nodes AUN`

### ComfyUI-Manager

- AUN is compatible with ComfyUI-Manager installs.
- Runtime Python dependencies are declared in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) (and [install.py](install.py) for Manager compatibility).
- If you install manually from git and see missing-module errors (e.g. `piexif`, `cv2`), install deps with:
  - `pip install -r custom_nodes/AUN/requirements.txt`

### Basic Usage

1. Start simple: begin with AUNBoolean or AUNSaveImage
2. Explore categories to find nodes that match your needs
3. Read tooltips: hover inputs for guidance and expected values
4. Check documentation: refer to individual node READMEs for complex nodes

### Best Practices

- Organize workflows using collapse/bypass/mute group nodes
- Document settings with labels and descriptions
- Save frequently while configuring complex setups
- Test incrementally before chaining many nodes

## 💡 Example Workflows

### How to Randomly Select a Prompt

Use `AUN Random/Select INT` with `AUN Text Index Switch` to randomly select a prompt.

1. Add nodes: `AUN Random/Select INT` (`AUNRandomIndexSwitch`) and `AUN Text Index Switch`.
2. Connect index: wire `INT` output to `index` input.
3. Set to Random: on `AUNRandomIndexSwitch`, toggle to Random.
4. Define range: set `minimum`/`maximum` to match the number of text inputs used.
5. Add prompts: fill `text1`, `text2`, `text3`, ... on the text switch node.
6. Use output: connect `text` to your CLIP Text Encode node.

Your setup: `AUN Random/Select INT` -> `AUN Text Index Switch` -> `CLIP Text Encode`
